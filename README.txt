This is the script I created and used for the weekly stock record chart.

Instructions:
Make sure to enter proper positive values when prompted. Don't enter letters else the script won't function.

Prompt Meanings:
  - Enter Start Price of Stock: You enter how much was initially invested into the stock.
  - Enter Previous Week's Price: You enter the value of the stock from the previouse week. If you just started your investment, use your initial investment.
  - Enter Current Stock Value/Close Value: Enter the value of the stock in the current time/from the most recent close.
  - Enter the number of shares bought: Self explanatory. Just enter the amount of shares you bought of that stock.
  
  After entering all the values for the four variables, you should receive an output.
